# BayesGLMM.jl
A Julia package for efficient estimation of Bayesian generalized linear additive and mixed effect models using variational approximations.
Markov chain Monte Carlo and mean field variational Bayes methods are also provided for comparison.
For a detailed description of the iterative optimization algorithms considered here, we refer the reader to [[1]](#1).
